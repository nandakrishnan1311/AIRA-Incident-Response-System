# AIRA – AI Incident Response & Root Cause Analysis System

AIRA is an AI-powered system that detects anomalous system logs and creates incidents automatically using machine learning.

## Phase 1 – Log Anomaly Detection
- Trained Isolation Forest on simulated system logs
- Used TF-IDF for log vectorization
- Unsupervised anomaly detection
- Model trained in Google Colab and versioned using GitHub

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- FastAPI (upcoming)
- React (upcoming)
